My fascination with spirituality has been a lifelong companion, but it was nearly 25 years ago that I truly embarked on my astrological journey. Out of curiosity, I visited an astrologist who used a distinctive system blending Western and Chinese astrology. I was utterly blown away by the accuracy of her insights into my life—she even predicted my emigration a few years later, along with other remarkable details.</div><div> </div><div>That experience ignited a passion for astrology and related spiritual fields. I dove into research and study, and when the astrologist offered a rare course on her unique system, I immersed myself fully. This knowledge transformed my worldview, revealing that life is not a series of random events but is guided by a traceable divine intelligence. It gave my life a profound new sense of meaning. In 2004, I moved to South Africa and expanded my studies, exploring Western and Vedic astrology as well as numerology. I began practicing by creating charts for family and friends, and soon, friends of friends.</div><div> </div><div>Over time, I built a substantial "body of evidence" affirming astrology’s power and accuracy. For years, I worked in marketing and sales in the corporate world, with astrology remaining my hobby and passion. However, the incredible feedback from my clients and the deep fulfillment I found in helping others understand and navigate their lives changed everything. I came to realize that my purpose in this lifetime is to share my spiritual knowledge with others. Embracing this calling, I have now dedicated my time and life to this pursuit.<p class="break-words">I invite you to explore my website to learn more about how astrology can illuminate your path and to discover the services I offer.</p></div></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://www.nadiology.co.za/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://www.nadiology.co.za/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=700105c316933a8202041b6415abb233"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
